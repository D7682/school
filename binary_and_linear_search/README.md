<h1>This is a project I wrote for school, because our teacher had asked us to write a binary and linear search algorithm</h1>

# Features
- You can choose whether to perform a binary or linear search on the array.
- You can enter values from the program manually in a comma separated fashion
- The program outputs the space and time complexity of each algorithm.
